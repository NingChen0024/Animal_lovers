                        the wound and disinfect it with alcohol or iodophor. After that, parents 
                        need to call the doctor to see if they need to be vaccinated. If the wound 
                        is severe or if bleeding cannot be stopped in time, parents should immediately 
                        take the child to the hospital.</p>

                        and disinfect them. In addition, children should change the clothes they wear 
                        when they play with animals, because there may be animal body fluids or feces. 
                        These clothes should be washed carefully. If the child feels unwell, he should 
                        go to the hospital immediately.</p>
